            <p> 
                My name is Valerie Fragier, and I was born in Yokosuka, Japan on January 6th 1994. My mother was born and raised in Olongapo City, Phillipines, and my father was born in Wilmington, Delaware. 
                With a strong military presense in my family, I moved to and from various countries and states;currently residing in Maryland.

                I am a first generation college graduate, and fluent in french and intermediate with Tagalog.I have an all white Japanese Akita; her name is Yuki, which means snow in Japanese.
                Also, I am the youngest of three kids, and since I have two older brothers I have a strong interestin sports and video games.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of my favorite games is Zelda, and with the nintendo switch there are plenty 
                of different things you can do in that game, espeically compared to the older versions.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have strong interests in law, politcs, and technology. Thus, my professional experience is very diverse as it ranges from working in the U.S Capital for Senator Tom Carper, to working for a reknown female lawyer for one of Delaware's largest law firms. 
                I am in a position that works with the stock market exchange for U.S and international stocks and bonds.
